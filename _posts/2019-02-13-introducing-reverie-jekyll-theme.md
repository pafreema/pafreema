title: Introducing Reverie - A ridiculously elegant Jekyll theme
categories: [Miscellaneous, Jekyll]
---

[Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-powered theme which is simple and opinionated. It's actually a fork of [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) with some additional features and personal touches which I've implemented to suit my needs for my blog.

This is a plug-and-play Jekyll theme which you can use on GitHub Pages without even setting up a local environment.
